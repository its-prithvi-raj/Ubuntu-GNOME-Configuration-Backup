# Ubuntu-24.04.1-LTS Gnome 46 Extensions-BackUp.

Extensions are stored in ```~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions```.

# To install

First install the **Extension Manager** from **Flathub** using `flatpak install flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager`. As this repo also contains the extensions with their configurations, just clone and copy all the contents into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` and restart the system or restart the session. 😺

I will keep updating the list if I install (or find) any new extensions. You are very much welcomed to contribute. 💙🤝
