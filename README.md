# Ubuntu-24.04.1-LTS Gnome 46 Extensions-BackUp.

Extensions are stored in ```~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions```.

# To install

First install the **Extension Manager** from **Flathub** using `flatpak install flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager`. As this repo also contains the extensions with their configurations, just clone and copy all the contents into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` and restart the system or restart the session. 😺

# Bash and other misc config

My WSL2, bash and other linux related configurations stored as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/itsmetheearthianbuoy/c97c5678ea81b2334dd8de6829ef6f96.js).

#

I will keep updating the list if I install (or find) any new extensions. Your contributions are very much welcomed. 💙🤝
